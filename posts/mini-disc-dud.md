[This article](https://www.osnews.com/story/14200/why-sony-shouldve-put-its-weight-behind-hi-md/) on OSNews tries to
argue for Sony and Hi-MD over “mp3 players”.

I used to be a huge fan of MiniDisc, but I am afraid it has failed as a format. Mostly because it is a Sony only format
and that data space has become so cheap to make it easy to invest in a single integrated device.

The article argues all of these “advantages” of the format, and I read the article thinking maybe I had missed something
now converting to on OGG centric view of the world with my
[iAudio](https://web.archive.org/web/20060518024930/http://eng.iaudio.com/) 20GB device. The biggest advantage I have is
that I still control my media at this point. No copy protection, no need to worry about “generational encoding”. Not
that I really ever plan to do anything illegal with my music (all of it ripped directly from the purchased CDs) I do
like the freedom to easily move my music around by simply copying it. Sony and ATRAC don’t offer this feature.
