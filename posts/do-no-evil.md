Personally I don’t agree. People are acting like if Google didn’t compromise
then people in China would get unfiltered Internet searches on Google. They
won’t, they just won’t get Google.

No matter how smart and intelligent the Chinese government gets, they cannot
keep the information out. It is better to have Google there providing what
information it can instead of totally eliminating it.

So I say, stop giving Google a hard time, while you may be able to avoid doing
evil, you can never avoid choosing the lesser of two evils.
