Well, all I can say is that it was nice that [Lord of the Rings](http://www.lordoftherings.net/) won
[11 Oscars](http://www.oscars.com/).

This marks an end of an era for me. I remember reading early articles by
[Peter Jackson](https://web.archive.org/web/20050311003621/http://tbhl.theonering.net/) on
[Ain't It Cool News](https://www.aintitcool.com/) some 6 years ago. Back just when New Line had just picked up the movie
and Jackson was re-writing from two scripts to three scripts. Of course the books that
[Professor Tolkien](http://www.tolkiensociety.org/) wrote possessed me as a child and truly made me interested in
literature. They had a more profound effect on me than probably any other book. Of course
[Elijah Wood](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/) is fairly attractive too, which helps.
