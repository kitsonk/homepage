I used to keep a quite regular blog, but I stopped some number of years ago. After several times being “frustrated” with
social media trying to rant or rave or express an opinion, I thought I would like to start my blog again. It really is
nothing but a space for me to vent publicly about things and spend some time externalising my thoughts. If you enjoy it,
so be it.

I remember the good ole days, when posting about [Da Vinci’s Notebook](http://www.davincisnotebook.com/), I become the
number one result for the search term for “[enormous penis](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=enormous+penis)” on Google
on my blog. Those were the proud good ole days. Wonder what is in store now…
