Well, finally couldn't stand it anymore. I need a blog in order to speak out. What it boils down to is that I am tired
of boring family and co-workers when a thought or idea strikes me. I had just seen something on TV which made me want to
go on do some research on the net. I found several interesting things and was in the process of e-mailing them off when
I really decided what I should do is setup a blog.

So here I am... the whole world wide web at my feet and no one can stop me from saying anything that I want.

So watch this space...
