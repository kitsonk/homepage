I was a bit frustrated last week. I had purchased tickets long ago to see
[Rufus Wainwright](http://www.rufuswainwright.com/) in concert. I totally enjoy him and am hopelessly infatuated but he
was an unknown concert quantity. On the other hand, my aunt invited me to go to see
[Richard Thompson](http://www.richardthompson-music.com/), which was a very well liked and known quantity in concert.

Alas, I ended up going to see Richard Thompson and coming back home and listening to Rufus Wainwright and getting
depressed! Oh well, I guess that makes sense in an odd way.
