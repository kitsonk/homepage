Someone ran into my mailbox yesterday, knocked the mailbox of its post and left
it lying in my driveway. I didn't even get as much as a little note.

So now I have to take time out of my day to go and fix my mailbox. Grrrrr... I
am so mad I could spit nails. Not even a freaking note. If anyone sees a mailbox
sized dent in someone's car, please let me know!!!!!!
