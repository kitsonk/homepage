I am a fairly active member of the [UK Yankee community](https://www.uk-yankee.com/) on the web, a community that
provides support and information to US expatriates in the UK. With over 1100 posts myself, I have seen a lot of
conversation on a lot of topics, but I was really really surprised how fast the community is reacting to the recently
announced "proposed" changes to the fees for visas, which I mentioned yesterday.

The discussion about it, as of right now as over 110 responses in less then 24 hours and a grass roots activism agenda
has been put together to write to the proper government ministers to talk about the impact of these changes to the
families and valued workers from the US in the UK. We as a community are planning to have our voice heard and represent
the over 5,000 members of the community.

I will keep everyone updated of the developments. I am especially curious to see how much visability we might get and if
this form of activism amoung our community can be used for furthering the causes and rights of immigrants from the
States in the UK.
