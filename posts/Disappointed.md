I am a little disappointed in this
[recent post](https://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/12/bariatric-surgery-doesnt-help-obese-live-longer-study-says/)
from CNN. It really is only giving a narrow view of the subject. It is
suggesting that bariatric surgery does not affect the mortality rate, but when
you actually read the article, it indicates it is a fairly narrow study. It only
included about 850 older US male veterans over a period of 6.5 years. There is
really no indication if there were other risks factors common to the group that
would have skewed the results, nor is there any indication of the make-up of the
control group. Significantly, the article says “older veterans” which would
indicate we are talking about a narrow part of the society.

Personally I think it is rather irresponsible of CNN to essentially “dismiss”
the potential benefits of bariatric surgery, especially for those that get the
procedure earlier on in life (and are US male veterans).
