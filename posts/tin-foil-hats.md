I guess what bothers me most is that there are people out there who generate
this sort of delusional psuedo-science that the great unwashed masses suck up.

Why do people a) believe anything they read and b) come up with this sort of
crazyness? Does it make us feel more important to think that the grand cosmos
unites to conspire against us? Do we honestly believe the governmnet has singled
out its citizens as public enemy number one?

Isn't it more resonable to assume that there isn't some grand conspiracy, but
instead a lot of people just as incompetent as us that are in charge, and that
provides the allusion of being subversive? Our current administration ultimately
isn't any smarter or has any more life experience than me, the Average Joe.

Sorry Niche, there are no supermen to come and rule us. Don't give the people in
power more credit than they deserve.
