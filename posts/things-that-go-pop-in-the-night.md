Well... I knew it was going to happen sooner or later, I just kept hoping for later. My Mitsubishi 900u monitor "blew
up" yesterday. I go to restart my computer and when the screen resolution change my monitor go "zzzzzzzzzzz ch ch ch
zzzzzzzzz _POP_" and I end up with a rather metallic smell and a nice little green blinking light on the power button.
Now I am not expert, but I assume that is bad.

So now I have to take my work laptop and RDP into my home computer until I can get a new monitor. My favorite site for
computer hardware is [NewEgg.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050311003739/http://www.newegg.com/). We live in a
wonderful time where in a couple clicks you can change your whole life. All the little people ants start moving around
and bingo, withing 24 hours you have a new monitor sitting at your doorstep. Ah!

Speaking of the marvels of modern life, I had to bow out of a family function which I really felt badly about. Do you
have any idea how it is to order flowers these days?
[1-800-Flowers](https://web.archive.org/web/20050311003739/http://www.1800flowers.com/) is a god send. Click click
click... and then awkward social moment solved. Same day delivery! Wowza.
