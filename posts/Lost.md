I have been losing weight since I went to [Structure House](https://www.structurehouse.com/) in October 2006. Originally
318 lbs, I have gotten myself down to around 228 lbs on most days. My original goal was to get to 218 lbs by September
2007 and it looks like I might make it.

To give you an idea, here is a picture of me when I was at Structure House:

Here is a picture me about 2 months after leaving Structure House:

And here is a picture taken last weekend:

As you can see, my weight loss is doing well for me and it has made a huge difference in my life. I hope anyone who
struggles with their weight can get into a situation where they can begin to tackle it and overcome those obstacles.
