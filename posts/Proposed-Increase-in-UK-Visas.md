IND is
[proposing that fees be increased for visas](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112042044/http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/6353/6356/17715/newfees2007.pdf).
While it is going to the House of Commons to be debated, it is unlikely that it won't be approved.

Many of the categories are increasing over 100%. ILR's for example will be going from £335 to £750. Also UKVisa
settlement visas will go from £260 to £500. Because of the pending changes for those in long term marriages only getting
an FLR upon entry, means that someone who lives outside the UK and marries a UK citizen and decides to move to the UK
will have to pay £1825 to become a UK citizen compared with £460 as of today. This represents a 296% increase.
