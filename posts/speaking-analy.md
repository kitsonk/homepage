From the [News of the Weird](https://web.archive.org/web/20050311003739/http://www.newsoftheweird.com/):

> A team of researchers that included Ben Wilson of the University of British Columbia (Vancouver) reported in November
> that herring communicate with each other via a high-pitched, "raspberry"-like sound emitted from their anuses. (Since
> the sounds were frequent, whether the herring had eaten or not, the researchers concluded that the noise was not
> produced by digestive gases.) [New Scientist, 11-5-03]
