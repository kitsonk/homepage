Now I am not naive enough to think that the NSA doesn’t do things to spy on American’s without proper oversight or
permission, but the amount of information that has come to light is rather amazing and takes consideration. For example,
USA Today has [revealed](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm) that the NSA has been collecting
and analyzing huge amounts of trap records of who’s calling whom. Of course the phone companies just layed down and
provided the information, except for Qwest, which was unsure if what the NSA was doing was legal.

What is more evident and more evident is that we are slowly slipping into what we so carefully guarded for 200 years. We
better all have the balls to change this when elections come around this year or else, we only asked for it.
