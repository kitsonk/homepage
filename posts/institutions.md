I was watching
[Real Time with Bill Maher](https://web.archive.org/web/20041208180632/http://www.hbo.com/billmaher/)
and [Sir Ian McKellen](http://www.mckellen.com/) was on. The subject of gay
marriage came up. He ended up quoting Thomas Jefferson, who had the following to
say on "institutions":

> "I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and
> constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with;
> because, when once known, we accomodate ourselves to them and find practical
> means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also that laws and
> institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that
> becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new
> truths disclosed and manners and opinions change with the change of
> circumstances, institutions must advance also and keep pace with the times. We
> might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy
> as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous
> ancestors."
>
> -- Thomas Jefferson to Samuel Kercheval, 1816

To say that our institutions of law and society were not meant to grow as we
grew is obviously an ignorant view point that contradicts what the framers of
our government thought.
