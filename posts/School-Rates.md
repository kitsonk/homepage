Well, it seems that the Universities partly got their way with the rate increases. They responded in mass to the
consultation about the fees and, [according to the BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6428399.stm), the
damage of the increased fees seems to be minimal.

The funny thing is the article mentions the increases to work visa costs, but makes no mention of the family related
visa costs. It seems like some people just want to sweep the whole impact on these type of visas under the proverbial
carpet.

Also it does seem that we family related visa holders and advocates need to find our voice a bit better and take the
time responding to these consultations.
