It seems that Clarke has gotten his wish after his appearance on 60 Minutes. The
hounds from hell have been unleashed on the earth.

Thanks for the Daily Show to point out that in all of the rhetoric, essentially
what the talking heads are saying when posed the question "Did the
administration focus too much on Iraq after the September 11th attacks?" the
resounding answer seems to be "Clarke is a jealous, lying, turncoat."

When specifically asked whether President Bush remembered the conversations
where he encouraged Clarke to find a connection with Iraq on September 11th, the
response was, "He doesn't recall. There is no record of him using the situation
room on September 12th." Again thanks to the daily show for pointing out, if he
didn't use the situation room on September 12th, what was he doing? Maybe he was
busy not reading the newspaper.
