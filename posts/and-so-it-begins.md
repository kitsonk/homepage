Well, it was going to happen sooner or later... And now it has happened. From
the headline on CNN: **Police board plane in Newark, detain 5** and from the
article:

> The plane was bound from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport when an air
> marshal notified authorities of five men he considered suspicious, according
> to Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New
> Jersey.
>
> They had no weapons, said Tim Smith, an airline spokesman.

We now detain people for being suspicious in the US. What a sad journey we are
taking. Remind me not to “look suspicious” in public anymore… Where is V when
you need him?
