It has been several years since I have been able to travel like I have wanted
to. In order to celebrate my return to determining my own destiny, my partner
and I have decided to go to New Zealand for 20 days.

Because of combinations of free flights and other things, I found myself with
about a 12 hour stop over in LA. It actually turns out to be a good break
between the 4 hours from ORD to LAX and then the LAX to AUK flight tonight. I
have been doing a little shopping and have stopped by a client of ours to fix up
a few things.

Anyways, I am getting ready to set off on my big adventure and my return to the
road warrior elite!
