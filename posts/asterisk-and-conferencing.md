Ok, more [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) news… It seems that my friends at
[GDS Partners](https://web.archive.org/web/20060522185609/http://www.gdspartners.com/)
have been busy. They just released their GDS Voice Conferencing Solution, which
is based on the Asterisk MeetMe but adds a full list of enterprise class
features, like:

- Multiple conference types (scheduled, recurrence, reservation-less)
- Intuitive web interface for conference management, personal contact
  management, user management and system administration
- Manage conference attributes like announce user leave/join, wait for marked
  user and associate contacts and its roles within the conference (listen only,
  admin mode etc.)
- Monitor live conferences (mute/un-mute participant, kick out participant, lock
  conference, view on line participants and its attributes etc.)
- Integrated personal contact management for simple invitation and notification
- Import existing contacts
- User roles based privileges
- Port resources management (TDM and VoIP)
- Recurrence and conflict conferences management
- Automatic email notifications and reminders
- API for integration with third party applications
