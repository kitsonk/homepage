I love [The Smoking Gun](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/). It always amazes me how us average people can become really
weird in an instant, and how famous people have just as many problems as us.

Recently [posted](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/three-hurt-geezer-salad-bar-brawl) was a report of a
brawl at a retirement home where one lady's son (age 61) was picking at the salad in the salad at the salad bar when an
78 year-old resident told the guy to stop, which the 61 year-old decided to tell the old man where to get off at. At
this point, the older guy called the younger one a child molester.

Now where I come from those is fighting words, even from a 78 year-old. Needless to say, a brawl ensued, which involved
biting and other injuries.
