Ok, coding nerd moment here. I have been becoming more and more involved in my
spare time with the [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/). For me it keeps my
mind in an enjoyable “problem solving” mode, which I enjoy, versus necessarily
all the fun of being a senior IT manager affords itself, where I wouldn’t get
near the sharp end of code even if I wanted to.

Because of that, I have started to investigate [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[github](https://github.com/). I had been impressed with Subversion before, but
git and github are a world of difference in my mind. The whole ability to fork,
push and pull makes it great for me to hang out on my own, but gives me the
ability to lob in contributions in a way that it is easy to manage and support.
For Open Source development it is the only way to go. Part of me didn’t want to
investigate it, because all the “cool kids” were using it, which usually means I
like something else that is slightly more interesting and cool.

Of course I told my partner about how interesting git was and that all the “cool
kids” were using it, to which he replied “You mean the nerdy cool kids? Think
about what you are saying.” Oh well… Back off to nerd land, sometimes far better
than reality…
